<h3 id="8-cookies-and-beacons">8. Cookies and Beacons</h3>
<p>Cookies help to improve your user experience and allow us to analyze our Site and to analyze and manage our advertising.

While some cookies are deleted when you close your browser (session cookies), others remain even after you close your browsing session (persistent cookies).</p>
<p>We may use cookies to save your preferences and to recognize you when you return to the Site. We also use analytics cookies to provide data about how users interact with our Site content and advertising campaigns, such as Site traffic. In addition, we use advertising cookies to manage, track, target and serve ads through our third-party service providers. You may not be able to access the full functionality of the Site if cookies are disabled on your browser.</p>
<p>Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The &ldquo;Help&rdquo; feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. For more information on how to manage browser cookies, see <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<h3 id="9-online-tracking--do-not-track-signals">9. Online Tracking / &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; Signals</h3>
<p>Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Our systems do not recognize browser &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals. If we do so in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe how we respond to such signals. We may work with third parties that use tracking technologies on the Site, including in order to serve tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These and other third parties may collect information about your activity on the Site over time, as well as your interaction with our advertising and other communications, and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and apps based on your interests. This is known as interest-based advertising.
